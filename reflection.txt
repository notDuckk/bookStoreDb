I really enjoy SQL and working with data. I love seeing how it all connects and allows for things to be remembered by a computer and used
in a real world environment. I found the subqueries challenging as i was previously only accustom to on straight forward query.
Its interesting to see how in depth it can go. I feel like this is much easier to pick up than java in particular, because of the simple syntax and
its more plain english than things like "public static void" for example...
